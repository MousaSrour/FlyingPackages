# FlyingPackages

This repo will help us to work on our Flying Packages project .

On Phase A folder we put all the products that realted to this phase.
The products are :

1. The book
2. Presentation (PPT)
3. Link for the Prototype-GUI (Axure).
4. UML Diagrams

For Phase B folder we have the implementation that includes the code,
and we have the products which are:

1. The book.
2. Presentation (PPT).
3. Clip for main scenario.

in order to run the code from the implementation file we need to make two steps :

1. open integreted terminal for the backend file and write npm start.
2. open integreted terminal for frontend file and write npm start.
3. if there are any missing files that cause a compile error write the command in the relevant terminal : npm force-- install
   this command will install all the dependencies for the project.
